Python-GMP
==========

Python extension module, gmp, providing safe bindings to the GNU GMP (version
6.3.0 or later required) via the `ZZ library <https://github.com/diofant/zz>`_.
This module shouldn't crash the interpreter.

The gmp can be used as a `gmpy2`_/`python-flint`_ replacement to provide
integer type (`mpz`_), compatible with Python's `int`_.  It includes few
functions (`comb`_, `factorial`_, `gcd`_, `isqrt`_, `lcm`_ and `perm`_),
compatible with the Python stdlib's module `math`_.

This module requires Python 3.9 or later versions and has been tested with
CPython 3.9 through 3.14, with PyPy3.11 7.3.20 and with GraalPy 25.0.
Free-threading builds of the CPython are supported.

Releases are available in the Python Package Index (PyPI) at
https://pypi.org/project/python-gmp/.


Motivation
----------

The CPython (and most other Python implementations, like PyPy) is optimized to
work with small integers.  Algorithms used here for "big enough" integers
usually aren't best known in the field.  Fortunately, it's possible to use
bindings (for example, the `gmpy2`_ package) to the GNU Multiple Precision
Arithmetic Library (GMP), which aims to be faster than any other bignum library
for all operand sizes.

But such extension modules usually rely on default GMP's memory allocation
functions and can't recover from errors such as out of memory.  So, it's easy
to crash the Python interpreter during the interactive session.  Following
example with the gmpy2 will work if you set address space limit for the Python
interpreter (e.g. by ``prlimit`` command on Linux):

.. code:: pycon

   >>> import gmpy2
   >>> gmpy2.__version__
   '2.2.1'
   >>> z = gmpy2.mpz(29925959575501)
   >>> while True:  # this loop will crash interpter
   ...     z = z*z
   ...
   GNU MP: Cannot allocate memory (size=46956584)
   Aborted

The gmp module handles such errors correctly:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> import gmp
   >>> z = gmp.mpz(29925959575501)
   >>> while True:
   ...     z = z*z
   ...
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<python-input-3>", line 2, in <module>
       z = z*z
           ~^~
   MemoryError
   >>> # interpreter still works, all variables in
   >>> # the current scope are available,
   >>> z.bit_length()  # including pre-failure value of z

Warning on --disable-alloca configure option
--------------------------------------------

You should use the GNU GMP library, compiled with the '--disable-alloca'
configure option to prevent using alloca() for temporary workspace allocation
(and use the heap instead), or this module can't prevent a crash in case of a
stack overflow.
